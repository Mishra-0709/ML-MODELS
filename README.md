# Personalized Color Recommendation System for Enhanced Shopping Experiences

## Overview

Despite the availability of a wide range of clothing options, customers often struggle to identify and choose colors that enhance their natural appearance based on their skin tones. This lack of personalized guidance results in less satisfactory shopping experiences, increased return rates, and reduced customer loyalty.

## Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we have developed an integrated feature within the shopping platform that leverages AI technology to provide personalized color recommendations based on the user's skin tone. This feature aims to enhance the shopping experience by offering tailored guidance and educational content.
